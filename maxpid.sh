/**
Explanation:

The #!/bin/bash shebang line tells the shell that this is a bash script.
The cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max command reads the value of pid_max from the /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max file.
The $() syntax is used to capture the output of the cat command and store it in the pid_max variable.
The echo command is used to print the value of pid_max to the terminal. The $pid_max syntax is used to substitute the value of the pid_max variable in the output string.
